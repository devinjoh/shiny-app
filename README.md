# shiny-app
This is for a shiny app created in R.  I am experimenting.

Global.R and app.R are the main code files.  I uploaded both of these files ot the shinyapps server.  The following website shows the combined output.  https://devinjoh.shinyapps.io/the_shiny_one/ 

The additional csv and png files are referenced in the two R files.
